# Editing Your uBuild Site
This website uses a Hugo theme called uBuild, which was designed to use Forestry's Blocks feature to create modular page layouts.

### Using Forestry
Forestry's [editing docs](https://forestry.io/docs/editing/) provide a good overview of how to use the editor.

### Creating a new blog
