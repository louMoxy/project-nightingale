# First blog post

  
Hi,

We are really excited to introduce to you the Project Nightingale blog, where we hope to keep you informed on research updates and events at the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases and build an online community for participants of Project Nightingale.

We would love to be able to create some blog posts sharing your personal stories also, both of using the app and of your experiences living with Ankylosing Spondylitis/ Axial Spondyloarthritis. If you would like to be involved and share your story or if you simply have any article ideas/comments/feedback or particular topics you would like us to cover, then please email Rosie, a research assistant from the University of Bath who is based at the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases on [rosie.barnett1@nhs.net](mailto:rosie.barnett1@nhs.net).

Thank you so much for being a part of Project Nightingale and for all of your efforts so far.

We look forward to hearing from you!
