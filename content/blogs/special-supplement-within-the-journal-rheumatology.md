I hope that everyone is keeping well during these strange times.<br><br>In rather exciting news, this month’s addition of <em>Rheumatology</em> (Oxford University Press) had a special supplement addition specifically regarding axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). The aim of this edition is to provide a comprehensive overview of axSpA for clinical rheumatologists and general physicians. Such educational tools/ research updates will hopefully be critical in raising awareness of axSpA and helping to reduce the delay to diagnosis.<br><br>You can find a link to the supplement here (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/issue/59/Supplement_4\" title=\"https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/issue/59/Supplement_4\">https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/issue/59/Supplement_4</a> - all Open Access), and we have provided a contents section and brief overview/ abstract section at the end of this blog post. We hope that you that find them useful! <br><br>As you will see, excitingly members of the Project Nightingale team were invited to write an article for the supplement specifically regarding the delay to diagnosis in axSpA – the link to the article is here: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keaa472\" title=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keaa472\">https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keaa472</a>. [<em>To note: unfortunately, at the publishing stage, the publishers made an error with our publication, whereby there is a minor typo in the abstract, and unfortunately the figures are ordered incorrectly (figure 2 and 3 should be figure 2a and 2b). Therefore, our final summary figure has unfortunately been missed out. This is currently being rectified by the publishers, but apologies if you see the article before these corrections have been made!</em>]<br><br>As always, if you are interested in Project Nightingale and would like to get in touch, <strong>please email Rosie at </strong><a href=\"mailto:rosie.barnett1@nhs.net\"><strong>rosie.barnett1@nhs.net</strong></a>, and she will be happy to discuss with you.

Despite being one of the oldest diseases known to man, with human skeletons showing evidence of radiographic axSpA (r-axSpA) or ankylosing spondylitis (AS) dating back to ancient Egypt, axSpA remains, to date, a challenge to researchers, particularly in its non-radiographic (nr-axSpA) form. This is largely related to the variability of outcome seen with some individuals having a ‘benign’ disease course with no significant symptoms or disease progression allowing for self-management, while others develop irreversible structural damage of the sacroiliac joints or even the spine, with the consequent loss of functional capacity and decreased quality of life, often early in the disease course. The latter, thought to represent an early, pre-radiographic sub-group is well characterized as a young, predominantly male population, HLA-B27 +ve and often presenting with MRI-related bone oedema. However, there is significant variation in nr-axSpA. This issue of Rheumatology aims to appraise the literature in the understanding of the different disease subsets within the axSpA spectrum, it discusses the ongoing challenges in diagnosis, the impact of sex and co-morbidities, and summarises recent findings in pathogenesis (how the disease develops) and treatment strategies."
