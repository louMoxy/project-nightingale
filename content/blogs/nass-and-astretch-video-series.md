# NASS and AStretch video series

  
Hi everyone! We hope you are having a good week. Quick update – NASS and AStretch have now released a series of videos on their Youtube, featuring people with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA – including those with Anklyosing Spondylitis \[AS\]) demonstrating ways to incorporate stretches and exercises into your daily life; including this useful video titled ‘Stretches in the kitchen’.

Other useful videos include ‘Get yourself going in the morning’ and ‘Safely moving from lying to sitting’.

For more information regarding the benefits of exercise in axSpA, you can also visit [https://nass.co.uk/managing-my-as/exercise/](https://nass.co.uk/managing-my-as/exercise/ "https://nass.co.uk/managing-my-as/exercise/"). As published in a previous blog post, initial results from the Project Nightingale study also seem to support exercise recommendations in axSpA – showing relationships between recommended exercise and: pain, fatigue, sleep, mood and stress. See previous blog posts for more details!
