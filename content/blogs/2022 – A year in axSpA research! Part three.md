Pearson and colleagues.</em> <a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/12/2/e053958\" title=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/12/2/e053958\">https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/12/2/e053958</a><br><br>In a previous <a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/12/2/e053958.full.pdf\">blog</a>, we touched on the symptom of fatigue and how it can be an important symptom for people with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). Research suggests that healthcare professionals rarely discuss fatigue in axSpA, and more effective communication is needed between people experiencing fatigue and clinicians due to their different perspectives.<br><br>Fatigue is not a well-researched symptom but in the studies that have explored this, it is described as <strong>“a complex condition that includes physical and mental fatigue, is different from normal tiredness, is unpredictable, can be affected by the weather or overexertion, and leads to a reduction in social engagement”</strong>. Fatigue has been rated as one of the top 3 symptoms that people with axSpA want to see addressed, with as many as <strong>66% of people with axSpA reporting fatigue; of these people, up to 75% report severe fatigue</strong>. The aim of this study was therefore to explore fatigue in the daily lives of people with axSpA.<br><br>Seventeen people with a diagnosis of axSpA from the UK took part in interviews to discuss their experience of fatigue. The average time since being diagnosed was 14 years, and according to the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), 7 out of the 17 (41%) participants had high disease activity. Some of the questions included in the interviews were:<br><br><strong>· </strong>  How would you describe your fatigue?<br><strong>· </strong>  What do you think causes your fatigue?<br><strong>· </strong>  What effect does fatigue have on your daily life?<br><strong>· </strong>  How do you deal with your fatigue?<br><strong>· </strong>  Is your fatigue discussed during your visits with healthcare professionals?<br><strong>· </strong>  What are the things that you would like a healthcare professional to ask you about when discussing fatigue?<br><br>The results of the interviews found that fatigue is a symptom that affected all aspects of people’s lives, was unresponsive to rest or sleep, was unpredictable, uncontrollable, and derailed plans. People talked about the difference between normal tiredness (due to lack of sleep) and fatigue, which had no pattern and no known cause. Pain could also worsen fatigue, and well-managed pain could relieve feelings of fatigue for some. People described having to make practical, personal, psychological, social and environmental changes to maximise their engagement in daily life as a result of fatigue.<br><br>The major finding from this study was the importance of ‘achieving balance’ in relation to the impact of fatigue. This reflects what people felt they must do to self-manage their condition, cope with their fatigue and its effects, and maintain their energy. Energy was referred to in a lot of detail in this study, and was described as <strong>“a short-term, daily resource that can be drawn on and replenished to sustain physical or mental activity”</strong>. In order to manage the level of energy and fatigue, people were having to identify, develop and appraise different approaches to ease or self-manage their symptoms. This new way of living life took years of ‘expertise’ to develop effective strategies tailored to their needs, incorporating trial-and-error approaches along the way. This highlights the burden of axSpA and fatigue on mental well-being.<br><br>Due to its ‘invisibility’, fatigue could also affect people’s mood, relationships, and degree of engagement. Low mood could in turn affect levels of exercise taken, which is crucial in axSpA as it can help to lower disease activity, and support better functional, pain and fatigue outcomes. However, as we have seen before, emotional and psychological well-being are not part of routine clinical assessment for axSpA. <strong>The National Axial Spondyloarthritis Society (NASS), who funded this study into fatigue and axSpA, has responded to this need by providing mental health support services on their website to help with emotional well-being.<br><br></strong>In summary, this study identified the importance of: (1) the concept of energy as a component related to fatigue experience, but also distinct from it; (2) the development of expertise to enable self-management; and, (3) perseverance due to the unpredictability of symptoms.<br><br><strong>Understanding the experience of fatigue could help people with axSpA and clinicians to work together to tailor treatments and facilitate the development of expertise, which could be key in ‘achieving balance’.<br><br></strong>If you would like to access NASS’ help on mental well-being and fatigue, please see the following resources on their website:<br><br><a href=\"https://nass.co.uk/about-as/\" title=\"https://nass.co.uk/about-as/\">https://nass.co.uk/about-as/</a><a href=\"https://nass.co.uk/about-as/%20what-is-as/your-wellbeing/\"> what-is-as/your-wellbeing/</a><a href=\"https://nass.co.uk/about-as/\" title=\"https://nass.co.uk/about-as/\">https://nass.co.uk/about-as/what-is-as/fatigue/</a><br><a href=\"https://nass.co.uk/resource/nass-guide-to-fatigue/\" title=\"https://nass.co.uk/resource/nass-guide-to-fatigue/\">https://nass.co.uk/resource/nass-guide-to-fatigue/</a><br><br>Do you suffer from fatigue due to axSpA?
