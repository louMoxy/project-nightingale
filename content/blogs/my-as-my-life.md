These sessions continued to provide support to people with axial spondyloarthritis (axial SpA) and maintain a strong sense of community throughout lockdown, when many of us were unable to see a healthcare provider or attend physiotherapy/ exercise sessions to help manage our health.<br><br>For this week’s blog, we again want to put a spotlight on the amazing work of the NASS team, and particularly Zoë Clark, NASS Self-Management Programme Officer, for their amazing, informative, ongoing Facebook live sessions and My AS, My Life resources; helping you build the skills and confidence to take control of your axial SpA (AS) and your life.<br><br>As stated on the NASS My AS, My Life website: “<em>On average you might spend 2 hours each year with a health professional discussing your axial SpA (AS). That leaves 8,758 hours where you have to manage your condition on your own. My AS, My Life helps you build the confidence and skills you need to self-manage your axial SpA (AS). It includes guides, videos, blogs and links to a whole range of issues covering both your physical and mental health.</em>”<br><br>The wealth of resources available on the My AS, My Life website are arranged into the following topics:<br><a href=\"https://nass.co.uk/managing-my-as/my-as-my-life/life-hacks/\">Life Hacks</a><br><a href=\"https://nass.co.uk/managing-my-as/my-as-my-life/axial-spa-in-depth/\">Axial SpA In-Depth</a><br><a href=\"https://nass.co.uk/managing-my-as/my-as-my-life/emotional-wellbeing/\">Emotional Wellbeing</a><br><a href=\"https://nass.co.uk/managing-my-as/my-as-my-life/exercise/\">Exercise</a><br><a href=\"https://nass.co.uk/managing-my-as/my-as-my-life/managing-pain/\">Managing Pain</a><br><br>If you haven’t already, we would highly recommend you taking a look at the <a href=\"https://nass.co.uk/managing-my-as/my-as-my-life/\" title=\"\">My AS, My Life website</a> and NASS <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NationalAxialSpondyloarthritisSociety/live\">Facebook page</a>.
