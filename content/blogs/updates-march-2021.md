This project is helping us to build a unique, novel daily self-report dataset of people with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), and we have already gained some extremely interesting, unique insights regarding flare using the data. However, there is so much more to learn/ be uncovered! Such an exciting opportunity for axSpA research - thank you all again."
