For those who are new to the Project Nightingale blogs, or may not be aware, we are currently posting 3-month article summaries from previously published research on axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). This blog post is for articles published from January to March 2021. Happy reading!!"

Steen and colleagues.</em> <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/msc.1537\" title=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/msc.1537\">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/msc.1537</a><br><br>This article begins by presenting some of the information we have previously seen in other articles on the <a href=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/good-morning/\">delay</a> to diagnosis and reasons for this delay. One of the key reasons for the delay has been identified as the <strong>lack of awareness of and screening for axSpA</strong>. The authors state that awareness and knowledge of axSpA has been explored amongst General Practitioners and other medical specialities, however <strong>there has not been research carried out to date into awareness of and confidence of musculoskeletal physiotherapists</strong> in assessment and referral of possible axSpA. As musculoskeletal specialists frequently assess people with back pain, they have a key role to play in identifying and referring suspected axSpA and improving delay to diagnosis. As such, this research study aimed to assess physiotherapists' clinical reasoning and management decisions on people presenting with persistent back pain, ability to differentiate inflammatory back pain and axSpA from other back pain, and evaluate awareness of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)<span class=\"MsoCommentReference\"> </span>guidance on <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng59\">back pain</a><span class=\"MsoCommentReference\"> </span>and recognition of clinical features and referral criteria for <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng65\">suspected axSpA</a>.<br><br>Physiotherapists who had at least one experience of treating persistent back pain were asked to complete a survey including examples of clinical presentations of symptoms, based on real patient cases. For each case presentation, respondents were asked to give their primary and secondary diagnoses, their ‘clinical reasoning’, direction of ‘further subjective screening’ and the management strategy.<br><br>- <strong>Only 60% of respondents (79 out of 132) were able to correctly identify a case of axSpA</strong>.<br>- <strong>Ninety‐four percent of respondents (50 out of 53) incorrectly diagnosed axSpA as non‐specific back pain</strong>.<br>- Not surprisingly, those with accurate answers were more familiar with NICE guidance on spondyloarthritis and had continuing professional development (CPD) on spondyloarthritis, and had higher professional grade.<br>- <strong>Non-recognition of axSpA was associated with less than 3 years musculoskeletal experience.<br></strong>- Only 4% of respondents who correctly identified axSpA mentioned the NICE guidance baseline (i.e. starting point) referral criteria in their ‘clinical reasoning’.<br><br>Of the 79 physiotherapists that correctly identified the axSpA cases, encouragingly <strong>92% made an appropriate management decision of referral for specialist opinion</strong>. Sixty one per cent of these referred to rheumatology.<br><br><strong>Correctly identifying axSpA was associated with higher confidence levels</strong> (8/10) in knowledge of clinical features of inflammatory back pain, the extra‐ articular and peripheral features associated with spondyloarthritis. However, confidence was still high in many respondents (59%) who inaccurately diagnosed axSpA. When asked about the knowledge of features of inflammatory back pain (a key axSpA feature), only <strong>27% of respondents recognised all features of inflammatory back pain (9/9)</strong>,and only 44% identified all additional NICE referral criteria (4/4).<br><br>The survey found limited awareness, knowledge and confidence in the recognitions of features of inflammatory back pain, associated extra‐articular conditions and other features that are associated with suspicion of spondyloarthritis. Physiotherapists are commonly involved in the assessment and screening of persistent back pain, and some concerns have been raised regarding their role in appropriate and timely referral for specialist assessment. Therefore <strong>physiotherapists are an important target for raising awareness of axSpA and professional education on recognition and referral to improve this issue</strong>. The misattribution may be partly due to poor awareness of the clinical features of axSpA, along with how common non‐specific back pain is (90%–95% of people reporting back pain).<br><br>One finding in this study was key: <strong>better recognition and appropriate referral were associated with physiotherapists' familiarity with NICE (2017) guidance on spondyloarthritis and previous professional education on spondyloarthritis</strong>. This suggests that educational campaigns to raise awareness of axSpA NICE guidance may improve recognition and referral of axSpA. This research study was published before the actonaxialspa campaign (<a href=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/good-morning/\" title=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/good-morning/\">https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/good-morning/</a>; <a href=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/good-morning/\" title=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/good-morning/\">https://www.actonaxialspa.com/</a>) was launched to raise the profile of axSpA among healthcare professionals such as physiotherapists, and it shows the huge impact that raising awareness can have. With the actonaxialspa campaign now launched, we can hope for improved recognition and referral of suspected axSpA once physiotherapists and other healthcare professionals have been trained and educated.<br>"
