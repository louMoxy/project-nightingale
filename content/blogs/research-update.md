# Research update!

  
Stanley Ng from White Swan has been analysing the latest Project Nightingale data and has produced our second round of results – assessing the correlations/relationships within the petal data, utilising a different method to that used by Simon (see blog post from 9th September for more details) and incorporating an additional time element.

Stanley’s analyses assessed the relationships between variables at each individual time point in the data set, for each person. In the tables below, the number of stars indicates the significance of the relationship. Interestingly, Stanley’s analyses incorporated data from the optional petals, in addition to the core petals and in the second table even looked at the correlation/relationships between the previous day’s symptoms/behaviour (for example pain -1), versus the current day (for example pain). Check out the results below! It is particularly encouraging to see that these results seem to support exercise recommendations in axSpA – showing relationships between recommended exercise and: pain, fatigue, sleep, mood and stress.

The next stage of analyses will involve studying these relationships in more detail and trying to understand symptom and behaviour patterns over time and how certain factors may influence these patterns. In particular, we are interested in what a flare means to each individual and whether or not we can identify common definitions. As described in our previous research update, in future research it will be important to determine whether there is a chronological pattern of symptoms within an individual or combination of variables that could predict a flare. Greater understanding of these patterns and identification of the optimal timing of intervention to ameliorate these symptoms may ultimately reduce flare frequency, duration and intensity, and greatly improve the quality of life for others with AS.
