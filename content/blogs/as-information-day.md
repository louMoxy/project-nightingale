# AS Information Day

Hi everybody! If you are looking at this for the first time today, then welcome.

It was great to talk to some of you at the BIRD AS Information Day – thank you so much for coming. I have attached some photo highlights below. We have already been discussing some great ideas for future research, in addition to ideas for the blog, which is fantastic – thank you for all your input. As discussed in my presentation, you can also find all the outlined initial Project Nightingale results in the previous blog posts. More updates to be published soon!

If you have any queries about anything, ideas or if you want to get involved with the blog, please feel free to contact me at [rosie.barnett1@nhs.net](mailto:rosie.barnett1@nhs.net). We are so excited about the development of Project Nightingale, and to start this online Project Nightingale community.

Again, thank you for coming today and for showing an interest in this project. And thank you also to all the other speakers for the fascinating talks! Finally, a special thank you to BIRD for organising this event – it was a pleasure to be a part of it.
