This week we have a bonus blog, as excitingly, our first full journal article utilising data from Project Nightingale has now been accepted for publication in <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/rheumap/pages/About\">Rheumatology Advances in Practice</a>.<br><br>The publication provides new insights into axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) flares, and was published online on the 15th November. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate, characterise and group daily self-reported flare profiles in people with axSpA, utilising a smartphone application and remote data collection. Below, we outline some of the key findings from the manuscript, and <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/rheumap/advance-article/doi/10.1093/rap/rkab082/6428672\">you can read the full publication online here.</a> Thank you to all of our participants for your logging efforts!<br><br>We also have an important Project Nightingale update published on our <a href=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/\">Home Page</a>. If you are an active Project Nightingale user, you will be notified of this via the app in the coming days (if not already!).<br><br>If you have any questions, please do get in touch via email to <a href=\"mailto:hello@projectnightingale.org\">hello@projectnightingale.org</a> â€“ we would love to hear from you.<br><br>Have a good rest of the week all!<br><br>Best Wishes,<br>The Project Nightingale Team"
