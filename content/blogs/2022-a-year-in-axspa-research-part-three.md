Soós and colleagues.</em> <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35273387/\" title=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35273387/\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35273387/</a><br><br>Inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) include rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthritis (SpA; peripheral SpA as well as ankylosing spondylitis (AS)) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). These conditions have been associated with both generalized osteoporosis (weakening of the bones) and fragility fractures, as well as erosions (localised inflammatory bone resorption) and/or pathological bone formation. Treatment for these additional conditions can involve biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and targeted synthetic DMARDs (such as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors). The effect of these targeted treatments on bone formation in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is not well understood. This article presents the most important mechanisms involved in pathological bone metabolism in RA and SpA, including AS.<br><br>Findings from the article are summarised below for AS:<br><strong>· </strong>  Wnt proteins, associated with the canonical Wnt signalling pathway, are important regulators of inflammatory bone formation, especially in SpA.<br><strong>· </strong>  Dickkopf 1 (DKK1) and sclerostin are important inhibitors of the Wnt axis and thus promote bone loss. Low concentrations of sclerostin and DKK1 have been found in SpA, and in AS this is associated with persistent inflammation and syndesmophyte formation.<br><strong>· </strong>  TNF stimulates DKK1 production and consequently inhibits the canonical Wnt signalling pathway, however TNF-induced production of DKK1 and sclerostin is low in SpA, suggesting that this is not causing bone loss in people with SpA.<br><strong>· </strong>  This could partly explain the inability of TNF inhibitors to stop syndesmophyte formation in SpA, as it is not being caused by TNF-induced DKK1 and sclerostin.<br><strong>· </strong>  After inhibiting IL-17A with secukinumab for 6 months in people with PsA, concentrations of DKK1 and sclerostin increased, suggesting that IL-17 is involved in the stimulation of Wnt-mediated osteogenesis (fragile bones)<br><strong>· </strong>  Bimekizumab, a dual inhibitor of IL-17A and IL-17F, was able to inhibit inflammatory bone formation, suggesting the use of IL-17 inhibitors could stop new bone formation in SpA.<br><strong>· </strong>  These results suggest that pro-inflammatory cytokines (proteins in the blood that cause inflammation) such as TNF and IL-17, can regulate DKK1 and sclerostin differently under inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions. Other mechanisms might also exist that lead to disparate changes in DKK1 and sclerostin release when targeted therapies are used.<br><strong>· </strong>  In the early, inflammatory stages of AS with no definitive radiographic damage of the sacroiliac joints, new bone formation might be more effectively controlled by bDMARDs including TNF and IL-17 inhibitors. This suggests that new bone formation is mostly driven by local inflammation.<br>· Osteoporosis can occur as a result of having AS, known as secondary osteoporosis. This is reported to be successfully treated with bDMARDs such as anti-TNF therapies, which slows the generalised bone loss and also prevents further bone mineral density.<br><strong>· </strong>  No studies on the effects of IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors on osteoporosis associated with RMDs exist, and very few studies exist on JAK inhibitors. It is suggested that JAK inhibitors could stop bone loss and promote bone formation, therefore more clinical data are needed to determine the effects of JAK inhibitors, and bDMARDs other than TNF inhibitors.<br><strong>· </strong>  People with SpA are also at higher risk of fragility fractures, but very few studies have assessed the success of targeted therapies for the prevention of fragility fractures.<br><strong>· </strong>  In one study of people with AS, treatment with etanercept increased bone mineral density, however the number of people with vertebral fractures and the severity of fractures increased, as did radiographic progression in the spine. Another study showed that anti-TNF treatment improved bone mineral density but did not affect rates of vertebral fractures in axSpA.<br><strong>· </strong>  More clinical trials using fragility fractures need to be conducted in inflammatory RMDs to understand more about how it can be treated."

Slobodin and colleagues. </em><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35305466/\" title=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35305466/\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35305466/</a><br><br>New bone formation is very common in people with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), however syndesmophytes, which is bone growth occurring inside a ligament, has been reported in the radiographic form of axSpA (r-axSpA). This most commonly occurs in the annulus fibrosis and adjacent ligaments, but the facet joints have also been identified as having bony growth formation. Facet joint ankylosis (joint stiffening/ immobility due to fusion of the bones) has also recently been reported in people with r-axSpA. As the facet joints are synovial joints (freely movable), inflammation may be present for prolonged periods before ankylosis is detectable, causing ongoing structural damage. This resulting structural damage is best assessed using computed tomography (CT) scanning. This study involved retrospectively assessing the facet joints of people with different forms of axSpA: r-axSpA with intervertebral syndesmophytes, r-axSpA without intervertebral syndesmophytes, and non-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA).<br><br>People who were included in the analysis were aged under 50 years on the day of the CT study, and had been diagnosed either using the 1984 modified New-York classification criteria for r-axSpA, or Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) classification criteria for axSpA. A control group including people without a diagnosis of axSpA, matched to the study group by age and gender, was included.<br><br>The assessment of CT images was performed by an experienced rheumatologist (17 years of CT reading experience) and a musculoskeletal radiologist (21 years of CT reading experience), who were both unaware of the diagnoses when presented with the CT images. Images included the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, and were categorised under the following:<br><strong>· </strong>  normal,<br><strong>· </strong>  disease-specific changes (ankylosis, erosion),<br><strong>· </strong>  degenerative changes (narrowing, osteophyte, sclerosis, cysts, vacuum)<br><br>A total of 49 people composed the study group of axSpA (average disease duration 7 years, average age 37.3 years, male 57%) and 44 people composed the control group (average age 38.5 years, male 64%).<br><br>Results are provided below in Figure 1 and Figure 2 for disease-specific and degenerative changes.<br><br><img src=\"/uploads/figure-1.jpg\"><br>Figure 1.
