This is reported to be successfully treated with bDMARDs such as anti-TNF therapies, which slows the generalised bone loss and also prevents further bone mineral density.<br><strong>· </strong>No studies on the effects of IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors on osteoporosis associated with RMDs exist, and very few studies exist on JAK inhibitors. It is suggested that JAK inhibitors could stop bone loss and promote bone formation, therefore <strong>more clinical data are needed to determine the effects of JAK inhibitors, and bDMARDs other than TNF inhibitors.</strong><br><strong>· </strong>People with SpA are also at higher risk of fragility fractures, but <strong>very few studies have assessed the success of targeted therapies for the prevention of fragility fractures.</strong><br><strong>· </strong>In one study of people with AS, treatment with etanercept increased bone mineral density, however the number of people with vertebral fractures and the severity of fractures increased, as did radiographic progression in the spine. Another study showed that anti-TNF treatment improved bone mineral density but did not affect rates of vertebral fractures in axSpA.<br><strong>· More clinical trials using fragility fractures need to be conducted in inflammatory RMDs to understand more about how it can be treated.</strong>"

This most commonly occurs in the annulus fibrosis and adjacent ligaments, but the facet joints have also been identified as having bony growth formation. Facet joint ankylosis (joint stiffening/ immobility due to fusion of the bones) has also recently been reported in people with r-axSpA. As the facet joints are synovial joints (freely movable), inflammation may be present for prolonged periods before ankylosis is detectable, causing ongoing structural damage. This resulting structural damage is best assessed using computed tomography (CT) scanning. This study involved retrospectively assessing the facet joints of people with different forms of axSpA: r-axSpA with intervertebral syndesmophytes, r-axSpA without intervertebral syndesmophytes, and non-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA).<br><br>People who were included in the analysis were aged under 50 years on the day of the CT study, and had been diagnosed either using the 1984 modified New-York classification criteria for r-axSpA, or Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) classification criteria for axSpA.

The fusion of two vertebrae occurs when a syndesmophyte has crossed the intervertebral disc space and formed a so-called bridging syndesmophyte to the adjacent vertebra. As seen in the previous article summary, bone formation can also occur in facet joints, causing facet joint ankylosis (FJA). However, the direction of the association between FJA and (bridging) syndesmophytes is unclear. Some evidence suggests that bridging syndesmophytes occur frequently with FJA in radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (r-axSpA), whereas other evidence suggests syndesmophyte development precedes FJA. Syndesmophytes have been reported to frequently occur and progress most in the thoracic spine.<br><br>This study examined the thoracic spine using low dose Computed Tomography (ldCT), which was used due to the ability to repeatedly capture images of the whole spine. There were two aims of the study. To examine whether:<br><br>1. presence of bridging syndesmophytes increases the risk of FJA using whole spine ldCT, and<br>2. presence of FJA increases the risk of syndesmophyte formation at the same or adjacent vertebral level.<br><br>51 people with r-axSpA (average age 49 years, 68% male) diagnosed using the 1984 modified New-York classification criteria were included in the study. LdCT and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images of the whole spine were collected at the start of the study (baseline) and two years later.<br><br>The findings of the study are presented below:<br><strong>· </strong>  Both FJA and bridging syndesmophytes are present at baseline in every vertebral unit, and occur more often in the thoracic spine, with bridging syndesmophytes occurring more often than FJA.<br><strong>· </strong>  In the majority of people, the number of vertebral units with bridging syndesmophytes exceeded the number of vertebral units with FJA.<br><strong>· </strong>  FJA or bridging syndesmophytes in an adjacent vertebral unit increases the risk of syndesmophyte development or FJA.<br><strong>· </strong>  Syndesmophytes appeared to be a strong risk factor for FJA, and not vice versa."
