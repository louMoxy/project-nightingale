Sorry to have been rather quiet over the past month - and especially so after attempting to get back into the swing of things with the regular blog posts! Unfortunately, unexpectedly, we had to migrate to a new website. Therefore it has taken some time for us to move everything over and get used to the new format.

However, now that we are all migrated, the new website will be easier to use and we have added some additional pages and resources which we hope you will find useful! Thankfully the URLs are all exactly the same as with the prior website, so hopefully you shouldn't have trouble finding us :) 

We will now be putting up blog posts every other Sunday morning, and will let you know of a new post as soon as it is up over on our research assistant Rosie's twitter page - [https://twitter.com/RosieBarnett95](https://twitter.com/RosieBarnett95 "https://twitter.com/RosieBarnett95"). If you are interested in writing a blog post for us, either about Project Nightingale or about your experiences with axSpA, please send Rosie an email at **rosie.barnett1@nhs.net**. We would love to hear from you.

Have a great weekend, and see you next week for the next research update!

Best wishes,

The Project Nightingale Team
