To ensure that people receive appropriate treatment and care earlier on in their condition, to ultimately improve clinical outcomes.<br><br>This campaign is essential for the wellbeing of many people who have been, or are currently, suffering with chronic back pain and awaiting a diagnosis. As the start of symptoms is often in the 20s-30s, the effects of the condition can be debilitating for those wanting to start their careers, relationships, etc during this period of their life. Many people who visit their GP with back pain may feel they are not being listened to or believed about their symptoms, and many others feel helpless and withdraw from care completely. The delay to axial SpA diagnosis, which will be longer for those that withdraw from care, may cause irreversible damage to the spine.<br><br><em>Would you like to share your experiences of diagnostic delay with the Project Nightingale community? If so, we would love to hear your story - please get in touch via </em><a href=\"mailto:ns2271@bath.ac.uk\"><em>ns2271@bath.ac.uk</em></a><em><br><br></em>"

content = "Although the past few decades have seen a huge increase in our understanding of the condition, including improvements in available treatments and improvements in diagnosis, the diagnosis of axial SpA remains complex, and the terminology can be confusing. For example, up until recently, the condition was known only as ankylosing spondylitis (<a href=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/axial-spondyloarthritis-what-is-axspa-and-how-does-it-relate-to-ankylosing-spondylitis/\" title=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/axial-spondyloarthritis-what-is-axspa-and-how-does-it-relate-to-ankylosing-spondylitis/\">https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/axial-spondyloarthritis-what-is-axspa-and-how-does-it-relate-to-ankylosing-spondylitis/</a>)! And in terms of public awareness, even just the name axial spondyloarthritis can be hard to pronounce!"
