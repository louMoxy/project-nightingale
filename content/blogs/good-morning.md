To ensure that people receive appropriate treatment and care earlier on in their condition, to ultimately improve clinical outcomes.<br><br>This campaign is essential for the wellbeing of many people who have been, or are currently, suffering with chronic back pain and awaiting a diagnosis. As the start of symptoms is often in the 20s-30s, the effects of the condition can be debilitating for those wanting to start their careers, relationships, etc during this period of their life. Many people who visit their GP with back pain may feel they are not being listened to or believed about their symptoms, and many others feel helpless and withdraw from care completely. The delay to axial SpA diagnosis, which will be longer for those that withdraw from care, may cause irreversible damage to the spine.<br><br><em>Would you like to share your experiences of diagnostic delay with the Project Nightingale community? If so, we would love to hear your story - please get in touch via </em><a href=\"mailto:ns2271@bath.ac.uk\"><em>ns2271@bath.ac.uk</em></a>"

content = "Although the past few decades have seen a huge increase in our understanding of the condition, including improvements in available treatments and improvements in diagnosis, the diagnosis of axial SpA remains complex, and the terminology can be confusing. For example, up until recently, the condition was known only as ankylosing spondylitis (<a href=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/axial-spondyloarthritis-what-is-axspa-and-how-does-it-relate-to-ankylosing-spondylitis/\" title=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/axial-spondyloarthritis-what-is-axspa-and-how-does-it-relate-to-ankylosing-spondylitis/\">https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/axial-spondyloarthritis-what-is-axspa-and-how-does-it-relate-to-ankylosing-spondylitis/</a>)! And in terms of public awareness, even just the name axial spondyloarthritis can be hard to pronounce!<br><br>One of the key aspects of early diagnosis is <strong>education</strong> and <strong>awareness</strong> of both healthcare professionals such as GPs and physiotherapists, and the general public. Below are some findings from research into the diagnostic delay in axial SpA:<br><br><em>There is a low level of specialist knowledge of axial SpA in primary care (that includes GPs)<br><br>Approximately 40% of people with axial SpA say they have received treatment from osteopaths or chiropractors before their diagnosis, many of whom may not have specialist knowledge on axial SpA<br><br>A recent survey of chiropractors and osteopaths found that the main perceived barrier to onward referral (to a rheumatologist) by a GP was that they did not want to accept their professional opinion!<br><br>Patients may find difficulty expressing their symptoms, and say that they have experienced negativity or reluctance from GPs to investigate further<br><br></em>There is a lot of outdated information available to GPs, such as the Oxford Handbook of General Practice, which still refers to late stages of axial SpA, with a focus on males and late disease features. In addition, there is said to be a strong genetic association with the human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27) gene, but <strong>up to 25% of axial SpA patients are HLA-B27 negative</strong>. Women are more likely to be HLA-B27 negative, and represent a huge 50-70% of individuals with non-radiographic axial SpA (nr-axial SpA), but sadly many GPs still believe that the disease occurs mostly in males.<br><br>The diagnosis of axial SpA is complex, and it involves more than an assessment of individual symptoms or tests. As well as GPs, <strong>rheumatologists also may not have the specialist knowledge of axial SpA </strong>or may not feel confident interpreting the various tests which are carried out, including MRI scans (for nr-axial SpA) which require being interpreted by a radiographer. Reassuringly, there have been new recommendations published which aim to support the training of rheumatologists/ radiologists in interpretating MRI scans where someone may have suspected axial SpA. <strong>This should help achieve a reliable diagnosis.</strong>"

content = "The idea for the Act on Axial SpA campaign was initially conceived by NASS CEO Dr Dale Webb, and consultant rheumatologist Dr Raj Sengupta (principal investigator of Project Nightingale!), and Professor Karl Gaffney. The campaign plan has involved an 11-month consultation process which included people living with axial SpA, healthcare professionals, professional bodies, commissioners, Parliamentarians and policymakers, as well as sending out a survey to them to get an idea of the kind of support there would be for this campaign. Workshops were also held with public health specialists, journalists, documentary makers and other communications experts to understand more about public awareness campaigning, and with stakeholders to get their input on the recommendations made. The campaign has been able to identify an integrated whole-system approach that uses multiple change levers, and allows the condition to be viewed in a way that involves all contributing factors, rather than just the disease itself. To put it another way, the intervention is both system-focussed (e.g. using pathways to follow for referral to simplify and standardise care) and people-focussed (e.g. using an online symptom checker for those with potential axial SpA)."
