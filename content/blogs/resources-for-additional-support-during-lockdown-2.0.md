content = "Hello everyone,<br><br>We hope you are having a good weekend and have managed to enjoy some of this lovely Autumnal weather! Indeed, we are living in some very unusual times. However, it has been glorious to have some sun at the beginning of this strange and challenging second lockdown (even if it is raining this afternoon!).<br><br>We understand that this is a particularly concerning time for people with axSpA and other chronic conditions whose care has inevitably been negatively impacted during the time of the COVID-19 outbreak. Despite the best efforts from those delivering clinical services, who always strive to provide the best care possible. We hope that the following post can provide some useful resources to help during this time. Organisations such as NASS and AStretch have done incredible work putting together useful information to help support individuals with axSpA throughout the pandemic. Yesterday we even saw the exciting Physio in Focus axSpA event; with a half-day full of talks, on topics such as managing sleep, coping with fatigue, and how to keep motivated to keep moving. Please see the links at the end of this blog post for further information.<br><br>We also thought we would provide a brief overview of some of the ongoing work of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for axSpA, and lessons learned from the current pandemic. To hopefully provide some positive news, in a somewhat challenging time!"
