Some exciting news this week – a new drug called Upadacitinib has been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), for use in Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS, radiographic axial spondyloarthritis – where changes can be seen on X-ray).<br><br>In light of this exciting news, we thought that it would be interesting to provide some more information about this novel drug below. We hope that you find it useful!<br><br>Enjoy the rest of the weekend.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>The Project Nightingale Team"

content = "Upadacitinib is a new form of drug, called a Janus Kinase inhibitor – or JAK inhibitor for short. The EU and U.S. approved Upadacitinib in 2019 under the brand name Rinvoq to treat moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).<br><br>JAK inhibitors target JAK enzymes. These enzymes are found inside cells and are involved in the signalling of a group of molecules known as cytokines. Cytokines are secreted by immune cells that influence immune or inflammatory responses. You may already be aware of one cytokine in particular - tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) – whose signalling is blocked by anti-TNF medication such as adalimumab (<em>known as Humira, Amgevita, Hulio, Hyrimoz, Idacio, Imraldi</em>), certolizumab pegol (<em>Cimzia</em>), etanercept (<em>Enbrel, Benepali, Erelzi</em>), golimumab (<em>Simponi</em>) and infliximab (<em>Remicade, Remsima, Inflectra</em>).<br><br>There are 4 known types of JAK enzyme, each with distinct biological roles. For example, JAK2 plays a key role in the development of red blood cells, platelets, and myeloid cells. Meanwhile, JAK1 regulates several pro-inflammatory cytokines. Upadacitinib targets JAK1 specifically. Thereby inhibiting pro-inflammatory pathways while minimising impact on important JAK2-dependent processes such as production of red blood cells and platelets. It is therefore suggested to have an improved benefit–risk profile compared with other less selective JAK inhibitors."

No serious infections, cancers, blood clots, or deaths were reported.<br><br>The most common adverse events reported with Upadacitinib included blood CPK increase (<strong>very high</strong> CPK level most often means that there has been stress to muscle tissue, the heart, or the brain), diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, headache and nausea. During hospitalisation for adverse events (distinct from SAEs), no significant findings were obtained (including normal CPK values), and the patients were discharged in good condition. These findings are consistent with those clinical trials for RA and PsA also, with no new significant safety risks identified."
