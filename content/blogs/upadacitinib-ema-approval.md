Some exciting news this week – a new drug called Upadacitinib has been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), for use in Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS, radiographic axial spondyloarthritis – where changes can be seen on X-ray).<br><br>In light of this exciting news, we thought that it would be interesting to provide some more information about this novel drug below. We hope that you find it useful!<br><br>Enjoy the rest of the weekend.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>The Project Nightingale Team"

content = "Upadacitinib is a new form of drug, called a Janus Kinase inhibitor – or JAK inhibitor for short. The EU and U.S. approved Upadacitinib in 2019 under the brand name Rinvoq to treat moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).<br><br>JAK inhibitors target JAK enzymes. These enzymes are found inside cells and are involved in the signalling of a group of molecules known as cytokines. Cytokines are secreted by immune cells that influence immune or inflammatory responses. You may already be aware of one cytokine in particular - tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) – whose signalling is blocked by anti-TNF medication such as adalimumab (<em>known as Humira, Amgevita, Hulio, Hyrimoz, Idacio, Imraldi</em>), certolizumab pegol (<em>Cimzia</em>), etanercept (<em>Enbrel, Benepali, Erelzi</em>), golimumab (<em>Simponi</em>) and infliximab (<em>Remicade, Remsima, Inflectra</em>).<br><br>There are 4 known types of JAK enzyme, each with distinct biological roles. For example, JAK2 plays a key role in the development of red blood cells, platelets, and myeloid cells. Meanwhile, JAK1 regulates several pro-inflammatory cytokines. Upadacitinib targets JAK1 specifically. Thereby inhibiting pro-inflammatory pathways while minimising impact on important JAK2-dependent processes such as production of red blood cells and platelets. It is therefore suggested to have an improved benefit–risk profile compared with other less selective JAK inhibitors."
