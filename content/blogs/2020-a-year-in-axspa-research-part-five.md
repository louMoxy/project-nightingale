The <a href=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/my-as-my-life/\">last</a> blog post was to inform you about NASS (National Axial Spondyloarthritis Society) Facebook live sessions and the <a href=\"https://nass.co.uk/managing-my-as/my-as-my-life/\">My AS, My Life website</a>. I hope you enjoyed reading the information. If you missed it, please have a look as there are some exciting and informative Facebook sessions scheduled through to December.<br><br>The current blog returns to the 2020 publication updates that we are providing you with. Currently, we are on October-December 2020, so we‚Äôre slowly getting there! I have found 3 articles which are very interesting."

Barnett and colleagues. </em><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keaa472\" title=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keaa472\">https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keaa472</a><br><br>The first of these articles is <strong>co-authored by our very own Rosie Barnett and Dr Raj Sengupta</strong>. The information provided in this article overlaps with the Act on Axial SpA: A Gold Standard Time to Diagnosis campaign in a previous blog <a href=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/good-morning/\">post</a>, which looked at ways of improving the current 8.5 years to diagnosis for axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA - which includes ankylosing spondylitis). The article outlines key factors contributing to delayed diagnosis in axSpA, and recommendations that should be implemented in order to reduce this delay.<br><br>This article provided information on axSpA having a very common symptom of <strong>chronic low back pain (CLBP)</strong>, which can be reported in <strong>about 20% of the population aged 20‚Äì59 years worldwide</strong>. But of those that have CLBP, <strong>only 5-24% have axSpA</strong>. Therefore, if someone doesn‚Äôt present with classical symptoms, the diagnosis of axSpA can be missed. There is also low awareness of the <strong>differences between mechanical back pain and inflammatory back pain</strong> amongst GPs and other non-rheumatology healthcare providers. Another important note is that <strong>absence of inflammatory back pain doesn‚Äôt mean a diagnosis of axSpA is excluded</strong>- so you can see the complexities involved in diagnosing! It is therefore <strong>vital to raise awareness and knowledge of axSpA symptoms among the public and healthcare professionals</strong>, to ensure early referral to rheumatology and faster diagnosis."

content = "<em>October 2020. Fragoulis and Siebert. </em><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33053192/\" title=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33053192/\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33053192/</a><br><br>Although there are some treatment options for axSpA, there are <strong>still unanswered questions regarding how best to use existing and upcoming treatments</strong>, in order to achieve the best outcomes for people with axSpA. Treatment for axSpA doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean taking medicine; it also includes non-pharmacological treatment such as exercise therapies, education, lifestyle and behavioural changes, and self-management. This non-pharmacological treatment should be a mainstay in axSpA care ‚Äì particularly structured exercise programmes as delivered by a specialist physiotherapist. At the time of this article being published, the current licensed drug treatments, or pharmacological treatment, for axSpA included non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). <strong>The combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment is the best way to treat axSpA </strong>‚Äì I‚Äôm sure many of you will agree with this!<br><br>The authors mention that regular exercise and stretching is recommended for the management of axSpA. Indeed, NASS (the national patient organisation for axSpA) suggest that <a href=\"https://nass.co.uk/managing-my-as/exercise/\">‚ÄúExercise is the single most important thing you can do to help yourself‚Äù</a>. A review of evidence in this area showed there are likely to be long-term benefits of exercise/stretching on aspects of the disease, including for those diagnosed with other conditions (co-morbidities), as well as on general physical and mental health. The <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qs170/chapter/Quality-statement-3-Physiotherapy#what-the-quality-statement-means-for-different-audiences-3\">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence</a> (NICE) recommend that people with axSpA should be referred to a specialist physiotherapist to start structured exercise programmes to meet individuals‚Äô changing needs ‚Äì where <strong>benefits can include reducing the impact of the disease, improving or maintaining mobility, function and quality of life, enabling self-management, and reducing pain and fatigue</strong>. Indeed, in <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article/60/Supplement_1/keab247.176/6251664\">one of our recent studies in Bath</a>, we showed that there were long-term improvements in spinal mobility, function and disease activity scores following intensive education, physiotherapy and rehabilitation in the Bath residential rehabilitation programme. The data on spinal mobility, function and disease activity went all the way back to the 1990s- with <strong>an average duration between first and last visit in the clinic at 13.5 years!</strong> That is really impressive! This evidence strongly supports the integral role of education, physical activity and rehabilitation in the management of axSpA.<br><br>NSAIDs are the first type of drug treatment which are given to people with axSpA as this type of drug manages symptoms very well, and appears to show reductions in inflammation on MRI scans. NICE recommends that NSAIDs are given at the lowest effective dose to begin with, changing to another NSAID if at the maximum tolerated dose for 2‚Äì4 weeks does not provide adequate pain relief. bDMARDs, or biologic cytokine inhibitors, are the most effective currently available treatments across the axSpA spectrum - recommended as options for treating those who do not respond well to, or who cannot tolerate, NSAIDs.<br><br>Some predictors of response to treatment with bDMARDs in axSpA have been identified, in other words factors to identify those people that may be most likely to react well to the treatment. These include HLA-B27 positivity, younger age, shorter time having been diagnosed (disease duration), male gender, elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and inflammatory MRI features. Obesity and smoking are associated with not responding well. These predictors for ‚Äògood‚Äô response are useful, as there may be a higher likelihood of these people truly having active axSpA, as opposed to other causes of back pain, as discussed in the article above.<br><br>The authors state that it is currently unclear what the combined effect is of bDMARDs and NSAIDs on clinical outcomes and slowing radiographic disease progression (as shown on X-rays) in axSpA. Factors that predict radiographic progression may be helpful in identifying those people that would benefit from more intense and earlier treatment, however, these are currently unknown. Some studies have suggested that these may include higher disease activity, including CRP, HLA-B27 positivity, the presence of baseline syndesmophytes (bony growth originating inside a ligament), male gender, physically demanding jobs, smoking and socioeconomic status. The authors also raise an interesting point about whether those with shorter disease or symptom duration result in a better response to treatment. Again, currently there is no evidence that providing bMARDS earlier leads to better radiographic outcomes in axSpA (i.e. control of the inflammation and changes on x-ray).<br><br>This article raises some interesting questions and areas for further research, which could make the disease easier to manage both for people who are diagnosed and those helping to manage the condition. <strong>Even since the publication of this article, there have been advances in the treatment of axSpA</strong> ‚Äì with a new type of drug known as a JAK inhibitor, recently being approved for use in radiographic axSpA (ankylosing spondylitis ‚Äì where changes to the spine or sacroiliac joints are visible on x-ray). You can read about it in one of our prior blog posts: <a href=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/upadacitinib-ema-approval/\" title=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/upadacitinib-ema-approval/\">https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/upadacitinib-ema-approval/</a><br><br>There is a lot of positive movement in axSpA, so hopefully one day all of the ‚Äòpredictors‚Äô will be identified and these discussions will be a thing of the past! üòä"
