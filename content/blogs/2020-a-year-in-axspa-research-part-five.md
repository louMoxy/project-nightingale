Barnett and colleagues. </em><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keaa472\" title=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keaa472\">https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keaa472</a><br><br>The first of these articles is co-authored by our very own Rosie Barnett and Dr Raj Sengupta. The information provided in this article overlaps with the Act on Axial SpA: A Gold Standard Time to Diagnosis campaign in a previous blog <a href=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/good-morning/\">post</a>, which looked at ways of improving the current 8.5 years to diagnosis for axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA - which includes ankylosing spondylitis). The article outlines key factors contributing to delayed diagnosis in axSpA, and recommendations that should be implemented in order to reduce this delay.<br><br>This article provided information on axSpA having a very common symptom of <strong>chronic low back pain (CLBP)</strong>, which can be reported in <strong>about 20% of the population aged 20–59 years worldwide</strong>. But of those that have CLBP, <strong>only 5-24% have axSpA</strong>. Therefore, if someone doesn’t present with classical symptoms, the diagnosis of axSpA can be missed. There is also low awareness of the <strong>differences between mechanical back pain and inflammatory back pain</strong> amongst GPs and other non-rheumatology healthcare providers. Another important note is that absence of inflammatory back pain doesn’t mean a diagnosis of axSpA is excluded- so you can see the complexities involved in diagnosing! It is therefore vital to raise awareness and knowledge of axSpA symptoms among the public and healthcare professionals, to ensure early referral to rheumatology and faster diagnosis."
