While looking through the literature, it was impossible to squeeze everything from these 3 months into one blog post (too many interesting articles!). So, we have instead separated April - June into two posts. Today, we will be taking a look at 11 publications, published under <strong>4 themes</strong>: <strong>physical activity, smoking, obesity and biomarkers</strong>.<br><br>As always, we hope you enjoy reading through the study overviews/ discussions. If you have any questions, or would like to talk through any of these studies in more detail, please feel free to get in touch by emailing our dedicated Project Nightingale researcher <strong>Rosie at </strong><a href=\"mailto:rosie.barnett1@nhs.net\"><strong>rosie.barnett1@nhs.net</strong></a> and she will be happy to discuss with you (see September’s blog post for an introduction: <a href=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/and-we-are-finally-back-with-the-regular-blog-posts/\" title=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/and-we-are-finally-back-with-the-regular-blog-posts/\">https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/and-we-are-finally-back-with-the-regular-blog-posts/</a>).

One recent randomised controlled trial (RCT – generally referred to as the “gold standard” for testing treatments) found that high‐intensity exercise improved cardiovascular health and function and reduced disease symptoms (pain, fatigue, stiffness) and inflammation in 100 people with axSpA (see link for full publication: <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30745314/\" title=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30745314/\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30745314/</a>). The present paper by Bilberg and colleagues interviewed some of the patients participating in the RCT to gain an understanding of their experience of the programme.<br><br>To summarise, supervised high‐intensity interval exercise was perceived as challenging for both body and mind but was also described as a positive experience, with rapid bodily effects that strengthened respondents’ faith in their own bodies. The new experience seemed to have changed the respondents’ attitude and motivation for exercise and made them start taking charge of their health by challenging the disease. Exercise in a social context, under professional leadership, enhanced exercise self‐efficacy and helped the respondents to adhere to the exercise program.<br><br><br><strong>Evaluation of a special concept of physical therapy in spondyloarthritis: German multimodal rheumatologic complex treatment for spondyloarthritis.

As this article was published as an online pre-print last year. For many of us it can be hard to engage in adequate/recommended exercise, despite its proven health benefits. This study by Hilberdink and colleagues aimed to identify components needed to optimise exercise behaviour in people with axSpA.<br><br>The first three steps of the Intervention Mapping protocol used: 1) needs assessment; 2) identification of axSpA-specific exercise barriers and facilitators; 3) selection of effective intervention components addressing potentially modifiable barriers/facilitators. All three steps included reviews of the literature and semi-structured interviews with both people with axSpA and physical therapists.<br><br>Results showed that only a reported one third of people with axSpA currently exercise regularly, demonstrating especially a lack of strengthening and cardiorespiratory exercises. Several intervention components were then selected: education, motivational interviewing, goal setting, action planning, monitoring, feedback, tailoring, guided practice, therapists’ training and group exercise encouragement. Research such as this will hopefully provide a foundation for the development of more axSpA-specific exercise interventions, similar to the 2-week rehabilitation course in Bath. There is such a buzz in this area at the moment, especially regarding the development of digitally delivered programs.<br><br><br><br><img src=\"/uploads/bruno-nascimento-phigyugqpvu-unsplash.jpg\">"

However, <strong>response to the first TNF-alpha inhibitor did not differ significantly according to baseline smoking status</strong>.<br><br>The authors conclude that prescribers should dispel any subconscious bias that smokers may not respond as well to treatment. Nevertheless, emphasise the importance of smoking cessation, particularly given the high burden of heart disease in rheumatic patients. Furthermore, smoking is associated with more severe disease (activity, functional impairment and radiographic progression); although it is not known whether cessation leads to improvement in disease outcome.
