content = "Hi everyone,<br><br>I hope that you are all safe and well and enjoying this lovely Sunday morning!<br><br>Today’s blog post is part two in our 2020 research summary – providing updates from April 2020 – June 2020. While looking through the literature, it was impossible to squeeze everything from these 3 months into one blog post (too many interesting articles!). So, we have instead separated April - June into two posts. Today, we will be taking a look at 11 publications, published under <strong>4 themes</strong>: <strong>physical activity, smoking, obesity and biomarkers</strong>.<br><br>As always, we hope you enjoy reading through the study overviews/ discussions. If you have any questions, or would like to talk through any of these studies in more detail, please feel free to get in touch by emailing our dedicated Project Nightingale researcher <strong>Rosie at </strong><a href=\"mailto:rosie.barnett1@nhs.net\"><strong>rosie.barnett1@nhs.net</strong></a> and she will be happy to discuss with you (see September’s blog post for an introduction: <a href=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/and-we-are-finally-back-with-the-regular-blog-posts/\" title=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/and-we-are-finally-back-with-the-regular-blog-posts/\">https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/and-we-are-finally-back-with-the-regular-blog-posts/</a>). If you are on twitter, you can also follow <strong>**</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RosieBarnett95\" title=\"https://twitter.com/RosieBarnett95\"><strong>https://twitter.com/RosieBarnett95</strong></a><strong> **</strong> for regular research and Project Nightingale updates, including notifications for new blog posts!<br><br>If you yourself are interested in writing a blog post for us, we would also love to hear from you. Not only regarding your potential experiences with Project Nightingale, but also regarding your general experiences with axSpA. These can be posted anonymously, or with your name – whichever you prefer. Again, please email Rosie above, or get in touch using <a href=\"mailto:hello@projectnightingale.org\">hello@projectnightingale.org</a>. Here is a fantastic blog post published by John Wilkinson earlier this year, after receiving the challenge from his consultant: <a href=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/john-wilkinson-no-holding-us-back/\" title=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/john-wilkinson-no-holding-us-back/\">https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/john-wilkinson-no-holding-us-back/</a>.
