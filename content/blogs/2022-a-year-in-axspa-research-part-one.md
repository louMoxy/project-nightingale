This blog is based on an article from Project Nightingale’s own Rosie Barnett and Dr Raj Sengupta (Consultant Rheumatologist)! The article was published in January of this year and was chosen for a special themed issue in the scientific journal “Arthritis Care and Research (AC&amp;R)”.<br><br>In this article, Rosie and Dr Sengupta reflect on some of the changes made to axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) rehabilitation at the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases in Bath due to Covid-19. They outline the process of moving from an in-person rehabilitation programme to a virtual programme due to the Covid-19 pandemic, discuss the potential benefits and pitfalls of so-called “virtual rehabilitation”, the usefulness of completing data in-between clinic appointments, and also further research that the Project Nightingale team are currently working on.<br><br>An editorial is also summarised which provides a summary of findings on all the articles included in the special theme issue of AC&amp;R, titled “<em>Rehabilitation Sciences and The Rheumatic Diseases</em>”."
