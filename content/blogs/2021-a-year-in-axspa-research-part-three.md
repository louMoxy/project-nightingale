content = "Remission, or inactive disease, is what rheumatologists are aiming for when they treat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. However, a clear definition of remission is lacking for axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA).<br><br>Several attempts have been made to define remission in axSpA, but there is a lot of controversy concerning their applicability in clinical practice. This is partly due to the variability of the disease. Axial pain and morning stiffness are thought to be key in assessing remission, or inactive disease, whereas symptoms such as fatigue and peripheral pain are multifactorial and not always related to axSpA disease activity. Treatment intake (e.g. doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)), extra-articular manifestations (EAMs) (e.g. uveitis) or comorbidities (being diagnosed with other conditions), are all also important to take into account.<br><br>This study is about a survey conducted with rheumatologists from French private practice or hospitals to explore their perception of remission in axSpA, including the importance of key patient-reported symptoms, EAMs and treatment intake.<br><br><em>Methods<br></em>The first part of the survey was to rate 36 vignettes (descriptive cases of axSpA), using the question ‘do you consider this patient in remission: yes/no’. In the second part of the survey, clinicians rated which of a list of 12 items would be important to consider for remission. This list included: measures of disease activity (Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)), CRP (a marker of inflammation in the blood), NSAID use, EAMs (such as inflammatory bowel disease, acute anterior uveitis and psoriasis), and other explanations for the symptoms (e.g. fibromyalgia). The last part of the survey aimed to determine the interval of time needed for the rheumatologist to consider a patient in remission.<br><br><em>Results<br></em>For the first part of the survey, 463 out of 2400 (19%) vignette evaluations were classified as remission by rheumatologists.<br><br><strong>The results showed that axial pain and morning stiffness were the main elements used by rheumatologists in this study to define remission.</strong> <strong>These symptoms are key elements reflecting inflammation and disease activity in axSpA, and have been associated with structural progression.<br><br></strong>Although fatigue is important for patients, it was not thought to be key for defining remission for the rheumatologists included in the survey due to difficulty in measuring fatigue. Fatigue is included in the <a href=\"https://omeract.org/working-groups/axial-spa/\" title=\"\">ASAS/OMERACT core outcome domains for axSpA</a>, which is the set of outcomes that have been deemed as mandatory to include in all clinical trials for axSpA, which highlights its importance.<br><br>For the second part of the survey, <strong>five out of the 12 items were rated by rheumatologists as high priority in the evaluation of remission: morning stiffness (75%), axial pain (68%), EAMs (75%), NSAID use (71%) and CRP (66%)</strong>, whereas only 18% selected fatigue. Maintaining remission after discontinuation of NSAID therapy is also a point to consider in the view of a drug-free remission target.<br><br>Finally, for the third part of the survey, a person was considered in remission if inactive disease was present for at least 3 months for 42% of rheumatologists, at least 6 months for 36% and longer than this for 17%.<br><br>Interestingly, the results of this survey showed that using clinical measures of disease activity alone to define remission/ inactive disease would miss key items that rheumatologists rated as high priority for evaluation of remission/ inactive disease, such as NSAID intake and EAMs. The authors state that this highlights the limits of current composite scores, and <strong>reflects the importance of taking a holistic approach when evaluating axSpA, in the context of shared decision-making.<br><br></strong>As we can see from this article, another challenge emerges in the nature of axSpA!
