content = "A couple of weeks ago, we discussed the impact that rheumatology research has had on the current pandemic (see: <a href=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/2020-a-year-in-axspa-research-part-three/\" title=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/2020-a-year-in-axspa-research-part-three/\">https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/2020-a-year-in-axspa-research-part-three/</a>). This week, we will be discussing the excellent article by Helena Marzo-Ortega, Simon Whalley, Jill Hamilton and Dale Webb, highlighting the impact of the pandemic on axial spondyloarthritis (axial SpA) care.<br><br>As the world attempts to navigate the inevitable COVID-19 second wave, it has become clear that existing inequalities in healthcare have been further exacerbated during the pandemic. Particularly for conditions such as axial SpA, where services were already lacking. In the UK, earlier this year (in that somewhat distant pre-C19 time!), the National Axial spondyloarthritis Society (NASS) published the results of the national inquiry by the APPG (All-Party Parliamentary Group) on Axial Spondyloarthritis: <a href=\"https://nass.co.uk/news/mp-led-inquiry-reveals-failings-in-the-provision-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-care-across-england/\" title=\"https://nass.co.uk/news/mp-led-inquiry-reveals-failings-in-the-provision-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-care-across-england/\">https://nass.co.uk/news/mp-led-inquiry-reveals-failings-in-the-provision-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-care-across-england/</a>. This inquiry revealed significant gaps in axial SpA care and has been crucial in raising awareness of the current failings (<em>see figure below</em>).<br><br>Although this inquiry has undoubtedly been one of the first key steps to highlighting and calling for urgent changes/commitments to improve axial SpA care in the UK, COVID-19 has undeniably accelerated much needed change. This week’s discussed publication by Dr Helena Marzo-Ortega and colleagues touches upon this acceleration. The authors discuss results from a large-scale survey ran by NASS from May to July 2020, during the first period of lockdown and early recovery phase in the UK. The survey generated responses from 873 people with axial SpA and 80 healthcare professionals, to help better understand the impact of COVID-19 on people with axSpA and their health-care services in the UK."

Importantly, key issues were highlighted that require urgent attention: such as the optimisation of digital services in the NHS and ensuring that gaps in digital infrastructure and staff skills are addressed.<br><br>Furthermore, improved clinical coding is crucial to identify those people most at risk/ vulnerable and who require urgent attention. Not only in the event of further outbreaks, but also just to ensure the best possible care of patients in everyday service provision. Emphasis should also be given to ensuring that resources are in place to prevent the potential deterioration of patients while dealing with the backlog in appointments caused by the pandemic. Particular attention should be given to those who are newly diagnosed. Ensuring that people have access to the mainstays of axial SpA treatment – physiotherapy and hydrotherapy – is also crucial."
