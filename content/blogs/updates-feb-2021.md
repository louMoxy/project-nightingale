Thank you so much to all of our participants for logging their data, and allowing us to do this exciting research. The manuscript was looking at flare characterisation using daily self-reported symptoms and behaviour, as reported in the uMotif app. After submitting, manuscripts have to go through extensive review processes by the journal before potential acceptance for publication. And we may even have to submit it to a couple of places before it is accepted. However, you can be assured that as soon as it is published, you will be notified both on this blog and on our PhD student Rosie's twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RosieBarnett95\" title=\"https://twitter.com/RosieBarnett95\">https://twitter.com/RosieBarnett95</a>!"

Interviews were last week, and we are super excited to have someone new joining the team soon! This will enable us to expand and work on additional analysis of the Project Nightingale dataset, as well as potentially exploring other aspects of novel app development. We will introduce you to the new member once the position has been finalised! This role has been funded by the Sir Halley Stewart Trust, who we are extremely grateful to have supported this important work."
