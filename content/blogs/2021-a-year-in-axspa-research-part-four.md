Soulard</em> <em>and colleagues.</em> <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98732-z\" title=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98732-z\">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98732-z</a><br><br>There is a lot of evidence that suggests that gait pattern is adversely affected when performing a secondary or dual-task whilst walking such as carrying an object, talking with someone, calling or texting on a smartphone, or other attention-demanding tasks. If you are very mobile/active, it may be difficult to imagine that this would negatively affect gait pattern as we very often carry out another task while walking! This effect has been observed in young healthy individuals, and has also been reported in older adults and those with neurological disorders (such as stroke). <strong>The literature suggests that walking in older people, or those with some medical conditions, requires greater cognitive resources due to them having gait disorders, compared to young health people</strong>. Gait disorders are altered gait pattern which can be due to various things like age, deformities, weakness or pain. Recent studies have shown that similar gait disorders have been reported in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). This study aimed to compare gait patterns in people with axSpA while performing another task, compared to matched healthy people (matched by age range, sex, and ability to walk 180m without technical help). The authors make an important point which is that interpreting changes in dual-task walking performance is difficult, and it is dependent on various factors including gait capabilities of individuals. <br><br>For the study, people were asked to walk 10m at a comfortable speed and to carry a full cup of water in their dominant hand with the instruction to “perform both tasks as well as possible”. The performance of this task was assessed by any spillage of water. They also walked the same distance without carrying a full cup of water. Sensors with gait analysis software were placed on the shoes of people participating to measure the following:<br>· Speed: average walking stride velocity of forward walking<br>· Cadence: number of steps in a minute <br>· Stride length (m): Distance between two consecutive footprints on the ground, from the heel of a foot to the heel of the same foot, one cycle after<br>· Swing time: Portion of the cycle during which the foot is in the air and does not touch the ground<br>· Stance time: Portion of the cycle during which part of the foot touches the ground<br><br>People included in the study had an average disease duration of 11 years, average morning stiffness of 28 minutes, low disease activity and low impact on physical functioning. The results of the gait analysis showed that <strong>the gait of healthy people and people with axSpA was adversely affected in the same way when trying to carry out a manual task</strong>. This is an interesting finding because the authors of the article thought people with axSpA would be affected more when carrying out a task while walking. This finding could have been because carrying a full cup of water was not challenging enough, or that the people involved in the study had low disease activity. Nevertheless, it’s great to see that different types of studies are being conducted in axSpA to explore the effects of the disease. However, as this may be the first study to look at gait pattern in axSpA, more studies would need to be conducted to create a broader understanding of the impact of dual-tasking whilst walking.<br><br>If you have experienced any differences in your walking pattern while dual-tasking and would like to share your experience, feel free to email me on: <a href=\"mailto:ns2271@bath.ac.uk\">ns2271@bath.ac.uk</a>"
