Soós and colleagues.</em> <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35273387/\" title=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35273387/\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35273387/</a><br><br>Inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) include rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthritis (SpA; peripheral SpA as well as ankylosing spondylitis (AS)) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). These conditions have been associated with both generalized osteoporosis (weakening of the bones) and fragility fractures, as well as erosions (localised inflammatory bone resorption) and/or pathological bone formation.<br><br>Particularly in AS, a hallmark feature of the condition can be formation of bony growths within the ligaments of the spine, bridging between multiple vertebrae. These bony growths within ligaments are known as syndesmophytes, and the study of their development is key to helping us understand the condition.<br><br>Treatment for inflammatory RMDs can involve biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and targeted synthetic DMARDs (such as <a href=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/upadacitinib-ema-approval/\">Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors</a>). The effect of these targeted treatments on bone formation in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is not well understood. This article presents the most important mechanisms involved in pathological bone metabolism in RA and SpA, including AS.<br><br><em>What effect do targeted therapies have on bone in RMDs?<br><br></em><strong>· </strong>Research indicates that new bone formation might be more effectively controlled by bDMARDs including tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-17 inhibitors in <strong>the early, inflammatory stages of AS</strong> with no definitive radiographic damage of the sacroiliac joints. This suggests that new bone formation is mostly driven by local inflammation, and again highlights the importance of <a href=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/good-morning/\">earlier diagnosis in axSpA</a>.<br><strong>· </strong>Osteoporosis can occur as a result of having AS, known as secondary osteoporosis. This is reported to be successfully treated with bDMARDs such as anti-TNF therapies, which slows the generalised bone loss and also prevents further loss to bone mineral density.<br><strong>· </strong>No studies on the effects of IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors on osteoporosis associated with RMDs exist, and very few studies exist on JAK inhibitors. It has been suggested that JAK inhibitors may stop bone loss and promote bone formation, therefore more clinical data are needed to determine the effects of JAK inhibitors, and bDMARDs other than TNF inhibitors.<br><strong>· </strong>People with SpA are also at higher risk of fragility fractures, but very few studies have assessed the success of targeted therapies for the prevention of fragility fractures.<br><strong>· </strong>In one study of people with AS, treatment with etanercept increased bone mineral density, however the number of people with vertebral fractures and the severity of fractures increased, as did radiographic progression in the spine. Another study showed that anti-TNF treatment improved bone mineral density but did not affect rates of vertebral fractures in axSpA.<br><strong>· </strong>More clinical trials using fragility fractures need to be conducted in inflammatory RMDs to understand more about how it can be treated.<br><br><em>What key mechanisms are thought to be involved in RMD bone formation and bone loss? (This is where things get a bit technical!)<br><br></em><strong>· </strong>Wnt proteins (a type of signalling protein) are important regulators of inflammatory bone formation, especially in SpA.<br><strong>· </strong>Activation of the Wnt pathway promotes bone formation.<br><strong>· </strong>Dickkopf 1 (DKK1) and sclerostin are important inhibitors of the Wnt axis and thus promote bone loss.<br><strong>· </strong>After inhibiting IL-17A with secukinumab for 6 months in people with PsA, concentrations of DKK1 and sclerostin increased, suggesting that IL-17 is involved in the stimulation of Wnt-mediated osteogenesis (fragile bones).<br><strong>· </strong>Bimekizumab, a dual inhibitor of IL-17A and IL-17F, was able to inhibit inflammatory bone formation, suggesting the use of IL-17 inhibitors could stop new bone formation in SpA.<br><strong>· </strong>These results suggest that pro-inflammatory cytokines (proteins in the blood that cause inflammation) such as TNF and IL-17, can regulate DKK1 and sclerostin differently under inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions. <br><strong>· </strong>Other mechanisms might also exist that lead to disparate changes in DKK1 and sclerostin release when targeted therapies are used."
