content = "My name is Nuzhat, a new Research Assistant at the University of Bath. You may have seen Rosie’s blogs about the team hiring a new Research Assistant, and I’m very happy to announce that it’s me!<br><br><img src=\"/uploads/whatsapp-image-2021-08-17-at-1.jpg\"><br><br>I started my role in April 2021 and have been working with Rosie on a study related to Project Nightingale. This study explores virtual/ remote ways that rehabilitation has been provided to people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease over the past 10 years, and particularly since Covid-19. With the success of Project Nightingale and the Bath virtual rehabilitation programme (launched in response to Covid-19, see: <a href=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/rehabilitation/\" title=\"https://www.projectnightingale.org/rehabilitation/\">https://www.projectnightingale.org/rehabilitation/</a>), we aim to see if there are any similar interventions supporting people in a virtual/ remote way, and if so, what do they involve. This type of rehabilitation is often referred to as 'telerehabilitation', or the broader term 'telehealth' (although there are many more terms in use, I am using just a couple here!).<br><br>My background is in Patient-Centered Outcomes, mainly for Clinical Trials research for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based in the USA, but also collecting patient data for economic evaluations for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and other European regulatory bodies. I've had a lot of exposure to various health conditions in my previous role, and I've had the chance to listen to people's views on these conditions and topics related to their health-related quality of life.<br><br>From now, I will be the main person posting on the Project Nightingale blog: keeping you up to date with articles and news on axial spondyloarthritis! So I'm looking forward to providing these updates, including latest developments in research and technology.<br><br>We’ve been a bit behind with posting blogs (lots of other exciting project updates coming soon!), so we are playing a bit of catch-up! I’m continuing with Rosie’s last blogs from 2020, and have found three publications from July- September on work productivity in axial spondyloarthritis. Many of you may be in paid work, and may have experienced work productivity issues, either now or in the past. You are not alone, and this is an important issue that needs to be addressed as work pressures can contribute to exacerbating symptoms so it’s important to get the right support.<br>I found this topic interesting due to my diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)/ Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) and sadly ended up leaving my employment!<br><br>Have you ever experienced work productivity issues such as absenteeism, presenteeism at work, or work loss in your current role or in the past? How much support did you receive, from your employer or elsewhere? If you would like to get in touch and perhaps share your own experience of work productivity issues, please use the following email address: <a href=\"mailto:ns2271@bath.ac.uk\">ns2271@bath.ac.uk</a>.<br>If you are on twitter, you can also follow me using this link: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NShakaib\" title=\"https://twitter.com/NShakaib\">https://twitter.com/NShakaib</a> for regular research and Project Nightingale updates, including notifications for new blog posts!<br><br>Finally, if you are struggling to manage work alongside your symptoms, please do reach out for support. Here are some resources that you may find useful:<br><br><a href=\"https://nass.co.uk/managing-my-as/living-with-as/working/\" title=\"https://nass.co.uk/managing-my-as/living-with-as/working/\">https://nass.co.uk/managing-my-as/living-with-as/working/</a><br><br>Working from home with axial spondyloarthritis (axial SpA), including ankylosing spondylitis (AS)- this is a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/GjFzqS2bJEM\">video</a> discussing working from home with axial spondyloarthritis (axial SpA) or ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and gives advice on desk set up, positions to sit in, reducing back stiffness when working, and how to incorporate exercises throughout the dayI hope you enjoy reading these article summaries.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>The Project Nightingale Team<br><br>"
