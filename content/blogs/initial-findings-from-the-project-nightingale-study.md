Initial findings from the Project Nightingale study

We are pleased to announce that we have been invited to present a poster at the BRITSpA (British Society for SpondyloArthritis) Annual Scientific Meeting on the 25th and 26th September 2019, outlining some of the initial results from the Project Nightingale study. Thank you so much to all of you who are a part of it and who have been entering data into uMotif!

Using data collected between the 5th April 2018 and 4th March 2019, Dr Simon Jones from the University of Bath conducted an analysis to assess relationships between pain, fatigue, mood, stress, sleep and recommended exercise. For each participant, an average score for each variable was calculated over their total logging period – with a higher score representing a fuller uMotif petal and better outcome (for example a score of 5 for pain = no pain). For the whole population, relationships were then assessed between variables.

In the graphs below, each participant is represented by a circle. For each graph, the line then represents the correlation between variables – the steeper the line, the stronger the correlation/relationship. The density charts show the distribution of average scores. Below the graphs, please see the table of correlated variables – the more stars you see, the stronger the relationship between variables.

A data analyst from White Swan is now trying to add a chronological element to these analyses, but also incorporating your flare data – for example, to see whether there is a relationship between 2 days of previous sleep with potential imminent flare. Stay tuned for these results! In future research, it will be important to determine whether there is a chronological pattern within an individual or combination of variables that could predict a flare. Earlier intervention to ameliorate these symptoms may then ultimately reduce flare frequency, duration and intensity, and greatly improve the quality of life for others with Ankylosing Spondylitis/ axial spondyloarthritis.
