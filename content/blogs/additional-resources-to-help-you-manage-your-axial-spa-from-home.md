We have posted some links to some great websites and videos below – we hope you find these useful.<br><br>Enjoy the rest of your weekend!<br><br>All the best,<br>The Project Nightingale Team"

content = "This week the journal <em>Rheumatology</em> ran a brilliant discussion on twitter, discussing remote care in Rheumatology following the pandemic. Although it seems as though remote care is likely to continue in some form and is preferable for some patients, there are a lot of challenges (technical issues anyone?!). Especially if having to have a consultation with a new doctor, or if your first ever consultation for potential diagnosis is having to be done virtually. Thankfully, clinics are now able to offer and prioritise in-person appointments for those in flare or those newly diagnosed. In future it will be vital to work out what works best for each person at each specific time – virtual or in-person. <strong>As with all aspects of healthcare, patient preference and opinions should always be at the heart of any decision-making</strong>.<br><br>Catch-up with the journal club discussion on twitter at: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RheumJnl\" title=\"https://twitter.com/RheumJnl\">https://twitter.com/RheumJnl</a>. Or join Mr Motivator (yes, THE Mr Motivator) for his Journal Club workout below to get the British Society for Rheumatology on their feet!<br><br><strong>What are your thoughts on virtual consultations? Let us know by emailing </strong><a href=\"mailto:rosie.barnett1@nhs.net\"><strong>rosie.barnett1@nhs.net</strong></a><strong>.</strong>"
