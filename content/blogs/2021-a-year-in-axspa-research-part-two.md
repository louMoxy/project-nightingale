content = "Hello Readers!<br><br>What an interesting year it has been, and thank you for bearing with us as we resumed our research update blogs!<br><br>This year we have seen a manuscript published that reports some of our first results from the Project Nightingale dataset on flares in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), a new addition to the Project Nightingale team, the launch of the Act on Axial SpA campaign which is aimed at reducing the current average time of 8.5 years to diagnosis, lots of National Axial Spondyloarthritis Society (NASS) Facebook lives, and just recently we have had a research poster accepted at the British Society for Rheumatology Conference (this is based on the research I’ve been working on)!<br><br>Today’s blog continues with research updates for 2021- April to June. The first article summary is related to the project that I’ve been working on since starting my role in April 2021- the use of <strong>telemedicine in inflammatory arthritis</strong>. You may remember in my first blog, I mentioned that we are exploring virtual/ remote ways that rehabilitation has been provided to people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease over the past 10 years, and particularly since Covid-19. Broadly speaking, <strong>telemedicine is the diagnosis and treatment of patients remotely using digital telecommunications technology </strong>(although different terms are used in the literature such as telerehabilitation and telehealth). This type of remote care has increased hugely since Covid-19. The first article looks at the impact it has had in Italy."

Chevallard et al 2021.</em> <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00296-021-04863-x.pdf\" title=\"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00296-021-04863-x.pdf\">https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00296-021-04863-x.pdf</a><br><br>This study is based on data collected during the first lockdown that happened between March 1 2020 to May 31 2020 in Italy. The participants included people who live with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and ankylosing spondylitis (AS/ radiographic axSpA, r-axSpA). People receiving biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, or bDMARDs, subcutaneously (that is under the fatty layer of skin, for example in the tummy) or targeted synthetic DMARDs or tsDMARDs orally (through the mouth) were followed remotely. In Italy, these patients are required to receive their medication every two months. Results are presented before and after this 3-month lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic.<br><br>During the study, a rheumatologist called the study participants and asked them about any signs of disease activity, side effects related to therapy, comorbid pathologies (where multiple conditions are diagnosed), and COVID-19-related symptoms that might require the need for an outpatient rheumatological visit. The participants also entered data on Patient-Reported Outcome measures (PROs) which is data collected on the person’s health using tailored questions. In this study, generic PROs on general health (GH), pain, and fatigue were included, as well as AS/ r-axSpA disease-specific PROs such as Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath AS Functional Index (BASFI), and Bath AS Global Index (BASGI) – which you are probably familiar with filling out in clinic. This data was entered electronically using an app and was also monitored by the rheumatologist. If there were no issues, the outpatient appointment was postponed for two months. If any of the study participants had developed a disease flare, side effect, or telephone management was considered inadequate, an urgent outpatient re-evaluation was scheduled. The PRO data was completed before the lockdown (between 1st January 2020 and 1st March 2020) and after the lockdown (between 1st June 2020 and 1st August 2020).<br><br>A total of 341 patients with RA (137), PsA (85), or AS/r-axSpA (59) had a clinical evaluation or assessment by telephone interview, and also completed PRO data. 70% (449 visits) of in-person scheduled visits were postponed, with evaluations deemed sufficient via telephone, along with completing PROs electronically, and delivering drugs directly to study participants. For 193 telephone evaluations, it was deemed better to evaluate study participants with a standard outpatient visit and the drug was given at the hospital. Comparisons were made between those people that had at least 1 visit in person and those that received telemedicine alone. In addition, results were compared before and after the 3-month lockdown. There were no GH or pain differences before and after lockdown in any of the conditions, or by method of receiving care.<br><br>Although this study was only for a 3-month period, it shows that receiving care by telemedicine can be successful when combined with: a flexible approach (seeing a rheumatologist when necessary), the use of an app to measure PRO data, and the ability to deliver drugs directly to patients. It is important to note that <strong>telemedicine is best suited for people who have an established diagnosis (compared to newly diagnosed) and have stable disease. Telemedicine may not be the best option for those with a disease flare or if they have complexity of their disease which makes following-up remotely difficult</strong>.<br><br>Telephone consultations were chosen because of the need for a quick solution when lockdown began, but consultations could also take place by video calls. As mentioned above, in our latest research we are exploring ways that telemedicine can be used in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases. We hope to be able to report on aspects of telemedicine such as type of technology used, how long the study lasted, what data was collected during the study, amount of interaction with a healthcare professional, and so on. The results of this study will be reported around spring time next year, so watch this space!<br><br>If your routine or usual care has, or was, changed to being remote or virtual as a result of Covid-19, and you would like to share your story, feel free to email me on: <a href=\"mailto:ns2271@bath.ac.uk\">ns2271@bath.ac.uk</a>"
