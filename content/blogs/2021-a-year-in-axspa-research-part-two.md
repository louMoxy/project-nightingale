content = "Hello Readers!<br><br>What an interesting year it has been, and thank you for bearing with us as we resumed our research update blogs!<br><br>This year we have seen a manuscript published that reports some of our first results from the Project Nightingale dataset on flares in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), a new addition to the Project Nightingale team, the launch of the Act on Axial SpA campaign which is aimed at reducing the current average time of 8.5 years to diagnosis, lots of National Axial Spondyloarthritis Society (NASS) Facebook lives, and just recently we have had a research poster accepted at the British Society for Rheumatology Conference (this is based on the research I’ve been working on)!<br><br>Today’s blog continues with research updates for 2021- April to June. The first article summary is related to the project that I’ve been working on since starting my role in April 2021- the use of <strong>telemedicine in inflammatory arthritis</strong>. You may remember in my first blog, I mentioned that we are exploring virtual/ remote ways that rehabilitation has been provided to people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease over the past 10 years, and particularly since Covid-19. Broadly speaking, <strong>telemedicine is the diagnosis and treatment of patients remotely using digital telecommunications technology </strong>(although different terms are used in the literature such as telerehabilitation and telehealth). This type of remote care has increased hugely since Covid-19. The first article looks at the impact it has had in Italy."
