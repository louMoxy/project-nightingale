content = "<br>I hope you are having a great start to the weekend! <br><br>You may have recently seen a post by one of our team, Dr Simon Jones, circulating twitter last weekend - regarding a survey to help us better understand your opinions on a potential future Smartphone tool to measure BASMI reliably, at home. The survey should take approximately 20-30 minutes. And will help one of the university's PhD students, Violet Henderson, in her project developing novel tools to remotely measure BASMI. Particularly relevant in this strange new time of COVID and virtual appointments!<br><br>If you are interested in helping with Violet and Simon's research and voicing your opinions/attitudes/expectations, then please click the following link: <a href=\"https://bathreg.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/attitudes-of-as-patients-towards-self-management\" title=\"https://bathreg.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/attitudes-of-as-patients-towards-self-management\">https://bathreg.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/attitudes-of-as-patients-towards-self-management</a>.

Look out for part 3 of our \"2020 - a year in axSpA research series\" at tomorrow morning before 10am...<br><br>All the best,<br><br>The Project Nightingale Team<br><br><br><br><br><img src=\"/uploads/basmismartphonesurvey-page-001.jpg\">"
