Indeed, this year has been a challenge for us all. But one definite positive is the creativity and innovation that has been sparked by the pandemic!<br><br>From BIRD, we have seen the launch of their excellent podcast series - with a series on axial SpA to be launched soon. And from NASS, we have seen development of even more online resources, Facebook live sessions, and even a couple of live online events (with an excellent, very impressive virtual conference platform!). Of course we all miss those irreplicable face-to-face interactions that simply cannot be fully captured online. But this new way of delivering content has undoubtedly allowed many people who perhaps would be unable to attend in-person live events, the opportunity to engage with such content for the first time. Which can only be a positive thing!<br><br>On the current page, we hope to keep you up to date with any live events from BIRD or NASS coming up in the next couple of weeks that you can tune into. <br><br><strong>If there are any other events that you think should be included/ we may have missed, please do get in touch with Rosie at rosie.barnett1@nhs.net. We would love to hear from you!</strong>  "
