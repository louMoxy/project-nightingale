  content: Thank you so much to everyone who has participated in Project Nightingale.
    As of 2023, data collection for Project Nightingale is now on pause. We will continue
    to focus our efforts on optimizing a new data collection platform, to improve
    the experience for our participants. <br><br>The data that has been gathered as
    part of Project Nightingale will continue to improve our understanding of the
    condition. We feel passionately that in future, such work will ultimately help
    to improve the management of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA).<br><br>Thank you
    again to all of our participants.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>The Project Nightingale
    Team

  content: 'We recognise that people with Axial Spondyloarthritis (axSpA) may only
    have a 15-minute appointment when they visit the hospital for their check-up.
    These meetings are likely to focus on medication and trying to prevent the condition
    from progressing, rather than quality of life and wellbeing. Introducing…the <strong>‘Nightingale’</strong>
    study.<br><br>The Nightingale study is designed to empower people with axSpA to
    take control of their symptoms and improve their quality of life. Not only will
    the data gathered help consultants to help patients manage their condition, but
    they will be able to see their own ‘real time’ data on factors that may influence
    these symptoms, allowing a level of self-management.<br><br><em>[Please note that
    the below video was recorded back in 2018, when we launched the project in collaboration
    with a different app provider - umotif. We have now migrated to the My Arthritis
    app, for the next phase of the project] </em>  '

  content: It’s simple – join the study via the My Arthritis app and record a few
    bits of information each day to track your symptoms and movement. If you have
    a wearable device (like a FitBit/Apple Watch), the app will connect with it and
    automatically track sleep and exercise data. Currently, data recorded relating
    specifically to a patient’s quality of life – i.e. work, sleep, exercise and flares,
    is poorly recorded and can be subjective and prone to recall bias (it can be difficult
    to remember how your sleep has been affected over the last year, how many flares
    you have had etc). This app makes it easy!

  content: The data gathered in the Nightingale study can be used to help predict
    flares, adopt regular exercise programs and improve sleep, optimising a patient’s
    clinical consultation by addressing issues important to them. The data could also
    be used to help understand the benefits, or lack of, from any new treatments started.
    Importantly, this project is ongoing, so the longer you can log for the better
    – there is currently no end date for data entry! <strong>Please note:</strong>
    Only your consultant will be able to see individual-level data. However, by taking
    part, all data will be made anonymous to be used for research to help others with
    axial spondyloarthritis.
