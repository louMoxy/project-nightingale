  headline: Project Nightingale December 2021 update!
  headerColor: "#36E4DA"
  content: Thank you for visiting our website, and for your interest in Project Nightingale.
    Unfortunately, our contract with umotif (the current app provider) is coming to
    an end on 31st December 2021. However, our team are working hard to migrate to
    a new app, which we hope to release at the end of this year, or early next year.
    We are currently in the contracting phase with the new app provider, and are designing
    the look of the new symptom scales. We are really excited about this new phase
    of the project, and hope to have some updates for you soon! <br><br>If you would
    like to find out more about the new app, or migrate your existing umotif data,
    please reach out to hello@projectnightingale.org or use the box below to enter
    your email and one of our team will be in touch. We can then also reach out to
    you regarding any Project Nightingale-related updates! In the meantime, if you
    are new to Project Nightingale, please see the sections below to find out more
    about the history of the study, and our prior collaboration with umotif. We also
    have various other website pages for you to explore - including information on
    upcoming Facebook Live talks by the <a href="https://nass.co.uk/" title="">National
    Axial Spondyloarthritis Society</a> (see "<a href="https://www.projectnightingale.org/events/"
    title="">Events</a>" tab above), and a <a href="https://www.projectnightingale.org/blogs/"
    title="">blog</a> section where we post various axial spondyloarthritis research
    updates. You can also find all our Project Nightingale scientific conference abstracts
    and publications on the "<a href="https://www.projectnightingale.org/publications/"
    title="">Publications</a>" tab. Our first full Project Nightingale scientific
    manuscript was published just last month!<br><br>To our existing Project Nightingale
    participants, thank you for your patience while we undergo this migration and
    apologies for any disruption in your logging. If you have any queries, please
    email hello@projectnightingale.org and we will get back to you as soon as we can.
    Thank you for all your efforts!

  content: We recognise that people with Axial Spondyloarthritis (axSpA) may only
    have a 15-minute appointment when they visit the hospital for their check-up.
    These meetings are likely to focus on medication and trying to prevent the condition
    from progressing, rather than quality of life and wellbeing. Introducing…the <strong>‘Nightingale’</strong>
    study.

  content: The Nightingale study is designed to empower people with axSpA to take
    control of their symptoms and improve their quality of life. Not only will the
    data gathered help consultants to help patients manage their condition, but they
    will be able to see their own ‘real time’ data on factors that may influence these
    symptoms, allowing a level of self-management.<br>

  content: It’s simple – join the study via the uMotif app and record a few bits of
    information each day to track your symptoms and movement. If you have a wearable
    device (like a FitBit/Apple Watch), the app will connect with it and automatically
    track sleep and exercise data. Currently, data recorded relating specifically
    to a patient’s quality of life – i.e. work, sleep, exercise and flares, is poorly
    recorded and can be subjective and prone to recall bias (a patient trying to remember
    how their sleep has been affected over the last year, how many flares they have
    had etc). This app makes it easy!

  content: Project Nightingale’s study is now live! If you’ve not already downloaded
    the App and would like to take part please enter your email address below to get
    involved. It is important to note that currently, unfortunately participation
    in Project Nightingale is only available for patients with axSpA at the Royal
    National Hospital for Rheumatic Disease in Bath, or for people who have attended
    a clinical appointment here. If you have any queries about this, please email
    <a href="mailto:hello@projectnightingale.org">hello@projectnightingale.org</a>

  content: The data gathered in the Nightingale study can be used to help predict
    flares, adopt regular exercise programs and improve sleep, optimising a patient’s
    clinical consultation by addressing issues important to them. The data could also
    be used to help understand the benefits, or lack of, from any new treatments started.
    Importantly, this project is ongoing, so the longer you can log for the better
    – there is currently no end date for data entry! <strong>Please note:</strong>
    Only your consultant will be able to see individual-level data. However, by taking
    part, all data will be made anonymous to be used for research to help others with
    Axial Spondyloarthritis.

    the project then please contact <a href="mailto:hello@projectnightingale.org">hello@projectnightingale.org</a>
    to register your interest. The more interest we get, the more likely we’ll be
    able to put something on to help.<br>

  content: <strong>Do I have to own a fitness device or fitness app to participate?</strong>
    No, not at all. Any data that we can gather will prove useful so please do participate
    even if you do not have access to a fitness app or device.<br><strong>Which apps
    or devices are compatible with the UMotif app?</strong> Although you don’t have
    to synchronise an app or device, there are many that are compatible should you
    wish.<strong>Do I need to use the app regularly?</strong><br>Yes, please. We’re
    hoping for a 3-month trial with as much data as possible so please complete daily.<br><strong>Do
    I need to add my information at the same time each day?</strong> Ideally yes so
    that we can see an patterns. If you’d like to complete the motif retrospectively
    you can change the time of the entry during the update stage at the bottom of
    the page.<br><strong>Will I be reminded to complete the app?</strong> Yes reminders
    sent daily at 1830.<br><strong>If I’m tracking the affect of my menstrual cycle,
    how can I capture where in my cycle I am?</strong> Please use the daily diary
    to capture this information.<br>If you have any general questions about the study
    please email us at <a href="mailto:hello@projectnightingale.org">hello@projectnightingale.org</a>
    and we’ll be happy to help in any way we can.
