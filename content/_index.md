  headline: Project Nightingale x My Arthritis App
  headerColor: "#36E4DA"
  content: Project Nightingale was launched in 2018 by the Royal National Hospital
    for Rheumatic Diseases (RNHRD) in Bath, and is now entering an exciting new phase
    in collaboration with social purpose company Ampersand Health and the existing
    <a href="https://ampersandhealth.co.uk/my-arthritis/" title="">My Arthritis app</a>!<br><br>Project
    Nightingale allows people with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) to track daily
    symptoms and behaviour via a smartphone app. You can log how you are feeling on
    a day-to-day basis using trackers, and then view your logged symptoms over time
    via a graph. This provides you with a detailed record of how you have been feeling
    over time and can help you gain a better understanding of your symptoms and how
    they fluctuate. The app will also allow you to connect your wearable device if
    you have one. If you are consented to the Bath Spondyloarthritis Research Biobank,
    this unique data can then be used for research into axSpA, to help us gain a better
    understanding of the condition.<br><br>My Arthritis also offers three engaging
    and interactive 14-day courses, made specifically for those living with inflammatory
    arthritis, led by experts who understand what life with arthritis is really like.
    You can even try an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) or General Wellbeing
    course via the app, to help cope with your symptoms.<br><br>We really do see development
    of the project as a collaborative process - those of you living with axSpA are
    of course the experts, and we want to learn from you. So please do get in touch
    via email to <a href="mailto:hello@projectnightingale.org">hello@projectnightingale.org</a>
    if you have any ideas for app content that you want to see, or any community events
    that you would like us to put on in future.<br><br>Visit our <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublications.ampersandhealth.co.uk%2Fview%2F472283392%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7Crlb60%40bath.ac.uk%7Caf1aa8a4dfa94cd13f8f08d9e18677f0%7C377e3d224ea1422db0ad8fcc89406b9e%7C0%7C0%7C637788789951521814%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=PUTABizZq4MVQ32bFhFZtwfR5UsIqHcWf1YngN2FPJs%3D&amp;reserved=0"><strong>online

  content: 'We recognise that people with Axial Spondyloarthritis (axSpA) may only
    have a 15-minute appointment when they visit the hospital for their check-up.
    These meetings are likely to focus on medication and trying to prevent the condition
    from progressing, rather than quality of life and wellbeing. Introducing…the <strong>‘Nightingale’</strong>
    study.<br><br>The Nightingale study is designed to empower people with axSpA to
    take control of their symptoms and improve their quality of life. Not only will
    the data gathered help consultants to help patients manage their condition, but
    they will be able to see their own ‘real time’ data on factors that may influence
    these symptoms, allowing a level of self-management.<br><br><em>[Please note that
    the below video was recorded back in 2018, when we launched the project in collaboration
    with a different app provider - umotif. We have now migrated to the My Arthritis
    app, for the next phase of the project] </em>  '

  content: It’s simple – join the study via the My Arthritis app and record a few
    bits of information each day to track your symptoms and movement. If you have
    a wearable device (like a FitBit/Apple Watch), the app will connect with it and
    automatically track sleep and exercise data. Currently, data recorded relating
    specifically to a patient’s quality of life – i.e. work, sleep, exercise and flares,
    is poorly recorded and can be subjective and prone to recall bias (it can be difficult
    to remember how your sleep has been affected over the last year, how many flares
    you have had etc). This app makes it easy!

  content: The data gathered in the Nightingale study can be used to help predict
    flares, adopt regular exercise programs and improve sleep, optimising a patient’s
    clinical consultation by addressing issues important to them. The data could also
    be used to help understand the benefits, or lack of, from any new treatments started.
    Importantly, this project is ongoing, so the longer you can log for the better
    – there is currently no end date for data entry! <strong>Please note:</strong>
    Only your consultant will be able to see individual-level data. However, by taking
    part, all data will be made anonymous to be used for research to help others with
    axial spondyloarthritis.

    as much data as possible so please complete daily.<br><strong>Do I need to add
