  content: We recognise that people with Axial Spondyloarthritis (axSpA) may only
    have a 15-minute appointment when they visit the hospital for their check-up.
    These meetings are likely to focus on medication and trying to prevent the condition
    from progressing, rather than quality of life and wellbeing.Introducing…the <strong>‘Nightingale’</strong>
    study.

  content: The Nightingale study is designed to empower people with axSpA to take
    control of their symptoms and improve their quality of life. Not only will the
    data gathered help consultants to help patients manage their condition, but they
    will be able to see their own ‘real time’ data on factors that may influence these
    symptoms, allowing a level of self-management.<br>
