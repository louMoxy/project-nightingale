  content: We recognise that people with Axial Spondyloarthritis (axSpA) may only
    have a 15-minute appointment when they visit the hospital for their check-up.
    These meetings are likely to focus on medication and trying to prevent the condition
    from progressing, rather than quality of life and wellbeing.Introducing…the <strong>‘Nightingale’</strong>
    study.

  content: The Nightingale study is designed to empower people with axSpA to take
    control of their symptoms and improve their quality of life. Not only will the
    data gathered help consultants to help patients manage their condition, but they
    will be able to see their own ‘real time’ data on factors that may influence these
    symptoms, allowing a level of self-management.<br>

  content: It’s simple – join the study via the uMotif app and record a few bits of
    information each day to track your symptoms and movement. If you have a wearable
    device (like a FitBit/Apple Watch), the app will connect with it and automatically
    track sleep and exercise data.Currently, data recorded relating specifically to
    a patient’s quality of life – i.e. work, sleep, exercise and flares, is poorly
    recorded and can be subjective and prone to recall bias (a patient trying to remember
    how their sleep has been affected over the last year, how many flares they have
    had etc). This app makes it easy!

  content: Project Nightingale’s study is now live! If you’ve not already downloaded
    the App and would like to take part please enter your email address below to get
    involved.It is important to note that currently, unfortunately participation in
    Project Nightingale is only available for patients with axSpA at the Royal National
    Hospital for Rheumatic Disease in Bath, or for people who have attended a clinical
    appointment here. If you have any queries about this, please email <a href="mailto:hello@projectnightingale.org">hello@projectnightingale.org</a>

  content: The data gathered in the Nightingale study can be used to help predict
    flares, adopt regular exercise programs and improve sleep, optimising a patient’s
    clinical consultation by addressing issues important to them. The data could also
    be used to help understand the benefits, or lack of, from any new treatments started.
    Importantly, this project is ongoing, so the longer you can log for the better
    – there is currently no end date for data entry!<strong>Please note:</strong>
    Only your consultant will be able to see individual-level data. However, by taking
    part, all data will be made anonymous to be used for research to help others with
    Axial Spondyloarthritis.
