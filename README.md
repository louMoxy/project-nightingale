# Project Nightingale

This is a Hugo based website for the charity Project Nightingale. 

It uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for the static templates and Forestry for the CMS. 

Forestry allows the users to add 'Blocks' to pages so the content can be more customised. This project uses [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/) as a CSS framework

To run locally:
Make sure you have hugo install 
```
    hugo server
```
